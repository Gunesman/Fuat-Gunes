### 🏆 Featured Project: AutoScout Car Price Prediction EDA

**Project Link:** [Insert Project Repo Link Here]

**Project Overview:**

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) initiative focused on car price prediction using a dataset scraped from an online car trading platform in 2022. The dataset encompasses 13 car makes, 594 models, and various features, offering a rich source for data exploration and cleaning. This project serves as a bridge between the Data Analysis and Data Visualization courses, with successful completion being a prerequisite for certification.

**Project Stages:**

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Correcting incorrect headers and standardizing data formats.
    *   Identifying and addressing data anomalies (inconsistencies).
    *   Removing unnecessary columns.

2. **Handling Missing Values (Imputation):**
    *   Filling missing values for both categorical and numerical features.
    *   Employing imputation techniques to ensure data completeness without compromising integrity.
    *   Transforming categorical data into numerical form through encoding for compatibility with analysis and modeling tools.

3. **Handling Outliers:**
    *   Identifying outliers using statistical and graphical methods.
    *   Extracting meaningful insights by exploring relationships between variables.
    *   Making informed decisions about retaining, transforming, or removing outliers based on their impact on the dataset.

**Key Learnings and Skills:**

*   A deep understanding of exploratory data analysis and its significance in data science.
    *   Proficiency in cleaning, organizing, and analyzing real-world datasets.
    *   Strengthening Python programming skills by applying a variety of libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy.
    *   Generating meaningful visualizations to support insights and decision-making.
    *   Preparing datasets suitable for predictive modeling, laying a foundation for machine learning applications.

**Significance of EDA:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) enables a thorough understanding of the dataset, identifies missing data, outliers, and relationships between variables. It helps formulate and test hypotheses to guide future modeling efforts. It prepares datasets that align with business objectives and modeling requirements.

**Repository Guidelines:**

*   Participants are required to complete the project as outlined above.
    *   Commit the solution to their GitHub repository as part of their professional portfolio.
    *   Submit the GitHub repository link via the designated platform.

**Note:** If you have any visuals from the project, please send them to me, and I will add them to the README.
